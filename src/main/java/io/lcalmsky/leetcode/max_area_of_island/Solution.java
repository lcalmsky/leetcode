package io.lcalmsky.leetcode.max_area_of_island;

/**
 * <pre>
 * Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 *
 * Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 *  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 *  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 *  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 *  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 *  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 *  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 *  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
 * Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 * Given the above grid, return 0.
 * Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.
